# Introduction:

- Here you will find the first group Machine Learning Project proposed during the Data Science boot camp from Spiced Academy (08.2023). 

- This project was proposed as a brief introduction to the Machine Learning topic.

- The goal here is to have a superficial analysis of the provided data using Python language.

- Last update: 09.2023. No changes in the structure or previous content of the original project. Changes were mostly made to improve the understanding of the notebook itself.

# The project structure: 

This repository contains five important folder with a total of eleven notebooks. All under the instructions given in the [introduction file](introduction.md).

- The [data](/data) folder it's where all the datasets are stored:
1- [](df_elect_mod.csv): 
2- [](df_fraud_dummy.csv): 
3- [](df_gas_mod.csv:) 
4- [](Merge_Frauddet_new.csv): 

- 
- You can find everything used to create this project's virtual environment in the [requirements](requirements.txt). 

- The [column descriptions](column_names.md) can also be found in this repository, in case the categories used for creating and analyzing the data are unclear. You will find there an explanation of the meaning of each category present in the original data sets.
